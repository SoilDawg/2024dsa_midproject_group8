# Project Description
 The objective of the project was to compare vertical distribution of soil carbon measured as loss-on-ignition carbon (LOI), soil nitrate (NO3) and soil pH to a depth of 90 cm between pastures with history of either broiler litter application (BL) or mineral fertilization (Min). The pastures used in this study have three different drainage classes; well drained (WD), moderately well drained (MWD), and somewhat poorly drained (SPD) distributed irregularly over the study pasture landscapes.A 20-m grid was used to determine sampling locations on each study pasture. A total of 160 soil cores were collected from 10 pasture units whose acreage and fertilization legacy are presented in table below.
 
|Pastures|Pasture Area (m2)|Fertilization Legacy|

|P1	|7891	|Broiler Litter|

# Data description 
Soil cores were cut into sections of 0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-40, 40-60, and 60-90 cm and analyzed for loss-on-ignition carbon (LOI) measured in grams per kilogram, nitrate (NO3) in milligrams per kilogram, and soil water pH (1 soil: 2 water). Each row in the dataset is a sampling point with its easting (column 1) and northing (column 2) projected in UTM (meters). All remaining columns except last two columns in the attached data set are values of individual soil property at individual depth for the 160 soil sampling points. Last two columns in the data set include soil series and drainage class at the point sampled.
